other than Dudley squeezed between them.
“Us — mistreat Dudders? What d’you — ?” began
Uncle V
ernon furiously
, but Dumbledore raised his
finger for silence, a silence which fell as though he
had struck Uncle V
ernon dumb.
“The magic I evoked fifteen years ago means that
Harry has powerful protection while he can still call
this house ‘home.’ However miserable he has been
here, however unwelcome, however badly treated, you
have at least, grudgingly
, allowed him houseroom.
This magic will cease to operate the moment that
Harry turns seventeen; in other words, at the moment
he becomes a man. I ask only this: that you allow
Harry to return, once more, to this house, before his
seventeenth birthday
, which will ensure that the
protection continues until that time.”
None of the Dursleys said anything. Dudley was
frowning slightly
, as though he was still trying to
work out when he had ever been mistreated. Uncle
V
ernon looked as though he had something stuck in
www.ztcprep.com
his throat; Aunt Petunia, however
, was oddly flushed.
“W
ell, Harry … time for us to be of
f,” said Dumbledore
at last, standing up and straightening his long black
cloak. “Until we meet again,” he said to the Dursleys,
who looked as though that moment could wait forever

as far as they were concerned, and after dof
fing his hat, he swept from the
room.
“Bye,” said Harry hastily to the Dursleys, and followed
Dumbledore, who paused beside Harry’
s trunk, upon
which Hedwig’
s cage was perched.
“W
e do not want to be encumbered by these just
now
,” he said, pulling out his wand again. “I shall
send them to the Burrow to await us there. However
, I
would like you to bring your Invisibility Cloak … just
in case.”
Harry extracted his cloak from his trunk with some
dif
ficulty
, trying not to show Dumbledore the mess
within. When he had stuf
fed it into an inside pocket
of his jacket, Dumbledore waved his wand and the
www.ztcprep.com
trunk, cage, and Hedwig vanished. Dumbledore then
waved his wand again, and the front door opened
onto cool, misty darkness.
“And now
, Harry
, let us step out into the night and
pursue that flighty temptress, adventure.”

HORACE SLUGHORN
Despite the fact that he had spent every waking
moment of the past few days hoping desperately that
Dumbledore would indeed come to fetch him, Harry
felt distinctly awkward as they set of
f down Privet
Drive together
. He had never had a proper
conversation with the headmaster outside of
www.ztcprep.com
Hogwarts before; there was usually a desk between
them. The memory of their last face-to-face encounter
kept intruding too, and it rather heightened Harry’
s
sense of embarrassment; he had shouted a lot on that
occasion, not to mention done his best to smash
several of Dumbledore’
s most prized possessions.
Dumbledore, however
, seemed completely relaxed.
“Keep your wand at the ready
, Harry
,” he said
brightly
.
“But I thought I’m not allowed to use magic outside
school, sir?”

“If there is an attack,” said Dumbledore, “I give you permission to use any
counterjinx or curse that might
occur to you. However
, I do not think you need worry
about being attacked tonight.”
“Why not, sir?”
“Y
ou are with me,” said Dumbledore simply
. “This will
do, Harry
.”
He came to an abrupt halt at the end of Privet Drive.
www.ztcprep.com
“Y
ou have not, of course, passed your Apparition
T
est,” he said.
“No,” said Harry
. “I thought you had to be seventeen?”
“Y
ou do,” said Dumbledore. “So you will need to hold
on to my arm very tightly
. My left, if you don’
t mind —
as you have noticed, my wand arm is a little fragile at
the moment.”
Harry gripped Dumbledore’
s prof
fered forearm.
“V
ery good,” said Dumbledore. “W
ell, here we go.”
Harry felt Dumbledore’
s arm twist away from him and
redoubled his grip; the next thing he knew
, everything
went black; he was being pressed very hard from all
directions; he could not breathe, there were iron
bands tightening around his chest; his eyeballs were
being forced back into his head; his eardrums were
being pushed deeper into his skull and then —
He gulped great lungfuls of cold night air and opened
his streaming eyes. He felt as though he had just
been forced through a very tight rubber tube. It was a
few seconds before he realized that Privet Drive had
www.ztcprep.com
vanished. He and Dumbledore were now standing in
P a g e 
| 64
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
what appeared to be a deserted village square, in the center of which stood
an old war memorial and a few
benches. His comprehension catching up with his
senses, Harry realized that he had just Apparated for
the first time in his life.
“Are you all right?” asked Dumbledore, looking down
at him solicitously
. “The sensation does take some
getting used to.”
“I’m fine,” said Harry
, rubbing his ears, which felt as
though they had left Privet Drive rather reluctantly
.
“But I think I might prefer brooms. …”
Dumbledore smiled, drew his traveling cloak a little
more tightly around his neck, and said, “This way
.”
He set of
f at a brisk pace, past an empty inn and a
few houses. According to a clock on a nearby church,
it was almost midnight.
“So tell me, Harry
,” said Dumbledore. “Y
our scar …
has it been hurting at all?”
www.ztcprep.com
Harry raised a hand unconsciously to his forehead
and rubbed the lightning-shaped mark.
“No,” he said, “and I’ve been wondering about that. I
thought it would be burning all the time now
V
oldemort’
s getting so powerful again.”
He glanced up at Dumbledore and saw that he was
wearing a satisfied expression.
“I, on the other hand, thought otherwise,” said
Dumbledore. “Lord V
oldemort has finally realized the
dangerous access to his thoughts and feelings you
have been enjoying. It appears that he is now
employing Occlumency against you.”

“W
ell, I’m not complaining,” said Harry
, who missed neither the disturbing
dreams nor the startling
flashes of insight into V
oldemort’
s mind.
They turned a corner
, passing a telephone box and a
bus shelter
. Harry looked sideways at Dumbledore
again. “Professor?”
“Harry?”
www.ztcprep.com
“Er — where exactly are we?”
“This, Harry
, is the charming village of Budleigh
Babberton.”
“And what are we doing here?”
“Ah yes, of course, I haven’
t told you,” said
Dumbledore. “W
ell, I have lost count of the number of
times I have said this in recent years, but we are,
once again, one member of staf
f short. W
e are here to
persuade an old colleague of mine to come out of
retirement and return to Hogwarts.”
“How can I help with that, sir?”
“Oh, I think we’ll find a use for you,” said Dumbledore
vaguely
. “Left here, Harry
.”
They proceeded up a steep, narrow street lined with
houses. All the windows were dark. The odd chill that
had lain over Privet Drive for two weeks persisted here
too. Thinking of dementors, Harry cast a look over his
shoulder and grasped his wand reassuringly in his
pocket.
“Professor
, why couldn’
t we just Apparate directly into
www.ztcprep.com
your old colleague’
s house?”
P a g e

Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
“Because it would be quite as rude as kicking down
the front door
,” said Dumbledore. “Courtesy dictates
that we of
fer fellow wizards the opportunity of denying
us entry
. In any case, most W
izarding dwellings are
magically protected from unwanted Apparators. At
Hogwarts, for instance —”
“— you can’
t Apparate anywhere inside the buildings
or grounds,” said Harry quickly
. “Hermione Granger
told me.”
“And she is quite right. W
e turn left again.”
The church clock chimed midnight behind them.
Harry wondered why Dumbledore did not consider it
rude to call on his old colleague so late, but now that
conversation had been established, he had more
pressing questions to ask.
“Sir
, I saw in the 
Daily Pr
ophet
 that Fudge has been
sacked. …”
www.ztcprep.com
“Correct,” said Dumbledore, now turning up a steep
side street. “He has been replaced, as I am sure you
also saw
, by Rufus Scrimgeour
, who used to be Head
of the Auror of
fice.”
“Is he … Do you think he’
s good?” asked Harry
.
“An interesting question,” said Dumbledore. “He is
able, certainly
. A more decisive and forceful
personality than Cornelius.”
“Y
es, but I meant —”
“I know what you meant. Rufus is a man of action
and, having fought Dark wizards for most of his
working life, does not underestimate Lord V
oldemort.”
P a g e

Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not say anything
about the disagreement with Scrimgeour that the
Daily Pr
ophet
 had reported, and he did not have the
nerve to pursue the subject, so he changed it. “And …
sir … I saw about Madam Bones.”
“Y
es,” said Dumbledore quietly
. “A terrible loss. She
www.ztcprep.com
was a great witch. Just up here, I think — ouch.”
He had pointed with his injured hand.
“Professor
, what happened to your — ?”
“I have no time to explain now
,” said Dumbledore. “It
is a thrilling tale, I wish to do it justice.”
He smiled at Harry
, who understood that he was not
being snubbed, and that he had permission to keep
asking questions.
“Sir — I got a Ministry of Magic leaflet by owl, about
security measures we should all take against the
Death Eaters. …”
“Y
es, I received one myself,” said Dumbledore, still
smiling. “Did you find it useful?”
“Not really
.”
“No, I thought not. Y
ou have not asked me, for
instance, what is my favorite flavor of jam, to check
that I am indeed Professor Dumbledore and not an
impostor
.”
“I didn’
t …” Harry began, not entirely sure whether he
was being reprimanded or not.
